      <p>Listen, eveyone has their GOAT movie but to me there's no topping The Dark Knight Rises. YEAH I SAID IT. In my opinion 
          Joker isn't even in the same ballpark as Bane. Remember when he had an entire army of prisoners at his side?
        That was pretty cool admit it.</p>

      <p>And don't get me wrong, Joker was a baaaaad man. He ran circles around Bruce's head. But cmon. Bane was killing Batman
        in the 1 v 1 in spite of Batman knowing a million different styles of mma. Plus the mask adds a 'Darth Vader' element.
      </p>

      <p>Bottom line. The ultimate battle between good vs evil with plot twists, a nuclear bomb, and an unstoppable bad guy with a crazy backstory.
        What more could you ask for?
